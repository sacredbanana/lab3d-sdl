July 1, 2001:

Some people have been pestering me to release the Ken's Labyrinth source
code, so I've decided that it was time to give it out to everyone. This is
the code from the full version of Ken's Labyrinth (LABFULL.ZIP) It is made
to compile in Microsoft C 6.00A (PLEASE NOTE that this is NOT Microsoft
Visual C++ 6.0, but actually an old 16-bit DOS compiler that was released
by Microsoft way back in 1990.) I have never tried compiling the code in
anything else, and I don't even want to think about it, so please don't ask!
