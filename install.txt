	LAB3D/SDL Installation
	======================

	Hardware requirements
	---------------------

LAB3D/SDL requires a machine capable of running Windows or a Unix-like OS
(e.g. Linux) and the Simple DirectMedia Layer with a little-endian CPU, and a
graphics card capable of OpenGL.

Recommended system:

- Pentium II or equivalent CPU.
- NVIDIA Riva TNT or better graphics accelerator (with OpenGL drivers).
- 101-key PC keyboard or similar.

Optional features:

- 16-bit sound card.
- MIDI sound.
- Two-button mouse or better.
- Joystick.

	Software requirements
	---------------------

Operating system:	Windows 95/98/Me/XP, Linux, Solaris, BSD, ...
Libraries:		OpenGL 1.2, GLU 1.3, SDL 2.0. Slightly older versions
			of GLU may work.
Compiler:		GCC 2.95.2 or later recommended. Other compilers will
			require Makefile changes, but should work.
Other utilities:	Makefiles require GNU Make (or compatible) and sh
			(or compatible, e.g. bash).
Data files:		Ken's Labyrinth v2.1 (Epic Megagames registered),
			Ken's Labyrinth v2.0 (Epic Megagames shareware),
			Ken's Labyrinth v1.1 (Advanced Systems registered) or
			Ken's Labyrinth v1.0 (Advanced Systems shareware).

Compiling (Unix with OSS support)
	---------------------------------

Run "make" in the source directory.

	Compiling (Windows)
	-------------------

Run "make -f Makefile.Win32" in the source directory. MinGW 3.1.0 is
recommended for Windows use.

	Compiling (Unix without OSS support)
	------------------------------------

Run "make -f Makefile.NoMIDI" in the source directory. Note that General MIDI
music is not available if you do this (not much of a loss).

	Compiling (Nintendo Switch)
	------------------------------------
Install DevKitPro.
Run "make -f Makefile.Switch" in the source directory.

	Installation (not applicable to full download)
	----------------------------------------------

Place the executable file ("ken" in Unix, "ken.exe" in Windows, "Kens-Labyrinth.nro" on Nintendo Switch), "ksmmidi.txt"
(if you want to use General MIDI music) and "ken.bmp" in the same directory as
your copy of Ken's Labyrinth. You may give the executable file a different
name if you like. Windows users should not change the extension of the
executable.

	Installation (Nintendo Switch)
	----------------------------------------------

To play this on your Nintendo Switch you will need a Switch set up to run homebrew software, then do any
of these three choices:
- Download the latest release of the game from https://github.com/sacredbanana/lab3d-sdl/releases,
- Download the game from the Homebrew Appstore. This is the easiest option and will also install the game for you automatically.
Or
- Compile the game yourself (see the Nintendo Switch compiling instructions above)

Navigate to the Switch folder inside your Nintendo Switch SD card and create a new folder
called Kens-Labyrinth. Inside this folder, transfer Kens-Labyrinth.nro and all of Ken's Labyrinth's data files.

	Setup
	-----

Before running the game, it may be a good idea to check the settings by
running the setup routine. If you have a script or batch file named "setup" or
"setup.bat", you can use this to start the setup routine. Otherwise, run the
main program with command-line parameter "-setup".

The setup routine is automatically run if no configuration file is found, so
you can force setup to run the next time you start LAB3D/SDL by deleting
the settings file ("settings.ini").
